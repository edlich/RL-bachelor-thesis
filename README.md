Projects that I am implementing for my bachelor thesis on reinforcement learning

## Tic Tac Toe
This directory contains different implementations of TicTacToe.
- **TicTacToe**: This is a basic game implemented in PyGame where one player can play against himself.
- **QAgent**: This version is used for training an agent with the Q-learning algorithm.
- **SarsaAgent**: This version is used for training an agent with the SARSA algorithm.
- **againstAgent**: In this version, a human player can play against a trained agent.
For playing against an agent trained with Q-learning, the file _qtable.json_ is required.
For playing against an agent trained with SARSA, the file _sarsa-table.json_ is required.
