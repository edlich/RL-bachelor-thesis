Projects that I am implementing for my bachelor thesis on reinforcement learning

## Tic Tac Toe
This directory contains different implementations of TicTacToe.
- **TicTacToe**: This is a basic game implemented in PyGame where one player can play against himself.
- **AgentVsAgent**: This version is used for training an agent with the Q-learning algorithm.
- **againstQAgent**: In this version, a human player can play against a trained agent. The file _qtable.json_ is required to read in values for the Q-table.
